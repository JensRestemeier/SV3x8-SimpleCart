# CROSS FORCE
This is my attempt at replicating the labels for Cross Force from a scan. There is some bleed area around both labels, they need to be cut along the line from the 
"cut" layer.

The font for the title seems to be "RockoUltraFLF Bold 700" (or at least a close match), the Spectravideo logo was traced from a manual. Colour matching is just roughly "by eye".
