# Labels
This is my attempt at replicating the labels for the released Spectravideo games. I have not tried to get them professionally printed, yet. I found you can use [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) to rename the colours used to guide the
cutting process into "CutContour" and "ThroughCut" and mark them as Spot Colours. 

## Super Cross Force
The font for the title seems to be "RockoUltraFLF Bold 700" (or at least a close match), the Spectravideo logo was traced from a manual. Colour matching is just roughly "by eye".

## Music Mentor
The font seems to be called "DavidaOpti-Bold".

## Sector Alpha
The font seems to be "Churchward Design Bold" made by Joseph Churchward.

## Flipper Slipper
The logo was cut out from a picture of the Colecovision box.

## Frantic Freddy
The logo was cut out from a picture of the Colecovision box.
