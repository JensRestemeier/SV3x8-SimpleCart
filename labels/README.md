# Labels
This is my attempt at replicating the labels for the released Spectravideo games. 

## Super Cross Force
The font for the title seems to be "RockoUltraFLF Bold 700" (or at least a close match), the Spectravideo logo was traced from a manual. Colour matching is just roughly "by eye".

## Music Mentor
The font seems to be called "DavidaOpti-Bold".

## Sector Alpha
The font seems to be "Churchward Design Bold" made by Joseph Churchward.

## Flipper Slipper
The logo was cut out from a picture of the Colecovision box.

## Frantic Freddy
The logo was cut out from a picture of the Colecovision box.
